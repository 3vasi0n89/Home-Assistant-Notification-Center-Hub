# Home Assistant Notification Center

This project will aim to centralize TTS and Device Notifications between all HA Notify Components.

Many thanks also to @lentron & @CCOSTAN  for laying down a lot of the groundwork for this.

I started using the Janet project by @lentron but it didn't meet all of my needs and the creator of the project seemed to have stopped making skills so I decided to take it a step further and create this repo to keep the new project more documented and kept up.

More info to come!
